# A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.

# Create tuple

fruits = ('Apples', 'oranges', 'Grapes')
#fruits2 = tuple(('Apples', 'Oranges', 'Oranges'))

#single value needs a trailing comma
fruits2 = ('Apples',)

#print(fruits2, type(fruits2))

# Get value
print(fruits[1])

# Delete tuple
# del fruit2

# get length
print(len(fruits))




# A set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
